My name is Lucas Habersaat, I studied computer science at ETH Zurich and just started my professional journey at the Esri R&D Center Zurich as a software engineer.  You can nerd out with me on productivity, computer graphics, games and fantasy books. This small website is mainly for me to share and write about my interests in a way that forces me to do it properly.

If you want to tell me something, contact me at <lucas@habersaat.ch>.
