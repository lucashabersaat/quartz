    title: Configuration
    content: "## Configuration\r\nQuartz is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\r\n\r\nThe majority of configuration can be be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Your name here! # Shows in the footer\r\nenableToc: true # Whether to show a Table of Contents\r\nenableLinkPreview: true # whether to render card previews for links\r\ndescription: Page description to show to search engines\r\npage_title: Quartz Example Page # Default Page Title\r\n\r\nlinks: # Links to show in footer\r\n  - link_name: Twitter\r\n    link: https://twitter.com/_jzhao\r\n  - link_name: Github\r\n    link: https://github.com/jackyzha0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Graph View\r\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nenableLegend: false # automatically generate a legend\r\nenableDrag: true # allow dragging nodes in the graph\r\nenableZoom: true # allow zooming and panning the graph\r\ndepth: -1 # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\r\npaths: # colour specific nodes path off of their path\r\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Styling\r\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \r\n\r\n### Partials\r\nPartials are what dictate what actually gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\r\n\r\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\r\n\r\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\r\n\r\nStill having problems?

    title: Custom Domain
    content: "### Registrar\r\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**! If you are using a `<YOUR-USERNAME>.github.io` domain, you can skip this step.\r\n\r\nFor this last bit to take effect, you also need to create a CNAME record with the DNS provider you register your domain with (i.e. NameCheap, Google Domains).\r\n\r\nGitHub has some [documentation on this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but the tldr; is to\r\n\r\n1. Go to your forked repository (`github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/quartz`) settings page and go to the Pages tab. Under \"Custom domain\", type your custom domain, then click **Save**.\r\n2. Go to your DNS Provider and create a CNAME record that points from your domain to `<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io.` (yes, with the trailing period).\r\n\r\n\t![Example Configuration for Quartz](/notes/images/google-domains.png)*Example Configuration for Quartz*\r\n3.

\notes\editing:
    title: Editing Content in Quartz
    content: "---\r\n\r\n## Editing \r\nQuartz runs on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so all notes are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).\r\n\r\n### Obsidian\r\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\r\n\r\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\r\n\r\n\U0001F517 [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\r\n\r\n### Ignoring Files\r\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\r\n\r\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\r\n\r\n### Folder Structure\r\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\r\n\r\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\r\n\r\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.** This is the home page which is slightly special. You don't need front matter here!\r\n\r\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\r\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder. The only caveat is that you should reference them in your Markdown by prefixing it with a `/`.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\r\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Front Matter\r\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\r\n\r\n```markdown"

\notes\hosting:
    title: Deploying Quartz to the Web
    content: "---\r\n\r\n## GitHub Pages\r\nQuartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\r\n\r\n### Enable GitHub Actions\r\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\r\n\r\n![Enable GitHub Actions](/notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\r\n\r\n### Enable GitHub Pages\r\n\r\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\r\n\r\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` using `/ (root)`\r\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\r\n\r\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\r\n\r\n### Pushing Changes\r\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is essentially a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as normal.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\r\ncd <path-to-quartz>\r\n\r\n# Commit all changes\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\r\n\r\n# Push to GitHub to update site\r\ngit push origin hugo\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\r\n\r\n### Setting up the Site\r\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\r\n\r\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`.\r\n\r\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nbaseURL = \"https://<YOUR-DOMAIN>/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing path.\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nbaseURL = \"https://<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.github.io/quartz/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `<YOUR-USERNAME>.github.io`.\r\n\r\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- name: Deploy  \r\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \r\n  with:  \r\n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\r\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \r\n\tpublish_branch: master\r\n\tcname: <YOUR-DOMAIN>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHave a custom domain?

    title: Ignoring Notes
    content: "---\r\n\r\n### Quartz Ignore\r\nEdit `ignoreFiles` in `config.toml` to include paths you'd like to exclude from being rendered.\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n...\r\nignoreFiles = [  \r\n    \"/content/templates/*\",  \r\n    \"/content/private/*\", \r\n    \"<your path here>\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ignoreFiles` supports the use of Regular Expressions (RegEx) so you can ignore patterns as well (e.g. ignoring all `.png`s by doing `\\\\.png$`).\r\nTo ignore a specific file, you can also add the tag `draft: true` to the frontmatter of a note.\r\n\r\n```markdown"

    title: Obsidian Vault Integration
    content: "## Setup\r\nObsidian is the preferred way to use Quartz. You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.\r\n\r\n### New Vault\r\nIf you don't have an existing Vault, [download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and create a new Vault in the `/content` folder that you created and cloned during the [setup](notes/setup.md) step.\r\n\r\n### Linking an existing Vault\r\nThe easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of your files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the `/content` folder.\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\nGreat, now that you have your Obsidian linked to your Quartz, let's fix some settings so that they play well.\r\n\r\n1. Under Options > Files and Links, set the New link format to always be Absolute Path in Vault and disabled WikiLinks so Obsidian generates regular Markdown links.\r\n2. Go to Settings > Files & Links > Turn \"on\" automatically update internal links.\r\n3. Use [[Wikilinks]] should be off (Wikilinks are not officially supported yet)\r\n\r\n![Obsidian Settings](/notes/images/obsidian-settings.png)*Obsidian Settings*\r\n\r\n## Templates\r\nInserting front matter everytime you want to create a new Note gets annoying really quickly. Luckily, Obsidian supports templates which makes inserting new content really easily.\r\n\r\n**If you decide to overwrite the `/content` folder completely, don't remove the `/content/templates` folder!**\r\n\r\nHead over to Options > Core Plugins and enable the Templates plugin. Then go to Options > Hotkeys and set a hotkey for 'Insert Template' (I recomment `[cmd]+T`). That way, when you create a new note, you can just press the hotkey for a new template and be ready to go!"

    title: Quartz Philosophy
    content: "> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming\r\n\r\n## Why Quartz?\r\nHosting a public digital garden isn't easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\r\n\r\nI've personally found that\r\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\r\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\r\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\r\n\r\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\r\n\r\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet."

Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (>= 1.16) installed.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\r\n$ go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\r\n\r\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\r\n$ cd <location-of-your-local-quartz>\r\n\r\n# Scrape all links in your Quartz folder and generate info for Quartz\r\n$ hugo-obsidian -input=content -output=data -index -root=.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\r\n\r\n##  Installing Hugo\r\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\r\n$ cd <location-of-your-local-quartz>\r\n\r\n# Start local server\r\n$ hugo server\r\n\r\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\r\n```"

    content: "## Making your own Quartz\r\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\r\n\r\n### Forking\r\n> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\r\n\r\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\r\n\r\n\U0001F4C1 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\r\n\r\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\r\n\r\n### Cloning\r\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Editing\r\nGreat!

\notes\troubleshooting:
    title: Troubleshooting and FAQ
    content: "Still having trouble? Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\r\n\r\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\r\n\r\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\r\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\r\ngit config core.ignorecase true\r\n\r\n# or globally (not recommended)\r\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\r\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\r\n\r\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\r\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\r\n\r\n### Do I need a website already?\r\nNo! Setting up Quartz means you set up a site too :)\r\n\r\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\r\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\r\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\r\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\r\n\r\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\r\nsource ~/.bash_profile\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\r\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\r\n\r\n### My custom domain isn't working!\r\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\r\n\r\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\r\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\r\n\r\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\r\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\r\n\r\n### How do I change the colours?\r\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\r\n\r\n### How do I add images?\r\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder. The only caveat is that you should reference them in your Markdown by prefixing it with a `/`.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\r\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\r\nBy default, the `linkIndex.yaml` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\r\n\r\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\r\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\r\n\r\n## Still Stuck?\r\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\r\n\r\n\U0001F41B [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)"
